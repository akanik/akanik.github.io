        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Throughout my 15 years in journalism I have been a developer, a reporter and an editor. Each role has 
            helped me develop skillsvthat span all aspects of data journalism, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>writing and editing data stories, </li>
            <li>designing and developing custom story layouts,</li>
            <li>scraping websites, </li>
            <li>writing well-documented code, </li>
            <li>analyzing data, </li>
            <li>creating data-driven visualizations and </li>
            <li>submitting FOIA requests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have also had the privilege to work for news organizations big and small, for profit and nonprofit. This has 
            deepened my understanding of how to use data and visuals to impact different communities.
        </p>
        <p>I've always enjoyed teaching data journalism and discussing how technology can improve news. Since my first NICAR 
            conference in 2014, I've been an annual speaker. Here are some of the past sessions I've facilitiated:
            <ul>

                <li><a href="https://github.com/akanik/nicar24-mapping-session" target="_blank">Make mapping better (2024)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUCnrv9iGuGIogdE3IduCMwNEJ9XjOOwtHQl7U-6ZzA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">How and when to open-source your code and analysis (2023)</a></li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to working with data, I also enjoy baking, biking and gardening. </p>

                        of Inyo County, CA. I built the site using Flask and Tailwind and incorporated component-based elements

                    <p>One of my greatest passions in journalism is bringing stories to life with design and development. 
                        This project is one of my favorites because I had an amazingly powerful and well-written story and
                        phenomenal photography to work with. I particularly enjoyed navigating the sensitivity necessary for
                        designing around these topics (school shooting, LGBTQ+, drag) for a Texas audience.</p>

                        For this story, we looked into crime on a neighborhood level, asking the questions: how has crime changed across the city, which 
                        crimes have gotten more and less common and which crimes are most prevalent in each neighborhood.

                    <p>I've always valued collaboration for the depth and creativity it can bring to journalism. This project was a
                        valuable collaboration across several NPR stations that allowed us to quickly develop scrapers and graphics to
                        track the progression of the COIVD-19. In addition to case and death data, we pulled in data on at-risk 
                        populations to better contextualize outbreak risk. We also made efforts to open source this project to make it
                        available for anyone to replicate for their own state.</p>

                        several articles analyzing the most and least housing-secure cities. (Pardon the layout, the site has undergone
                    a few revamps since 2020!)</p>
