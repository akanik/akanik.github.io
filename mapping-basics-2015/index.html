	<h2>What is a .qgs file?</h2>
	<p>When you save a map file, it will save as a .qgs. This file is a configuration file. It basically just references the files that you load into QGIS. IT DOES NOT HOLD ANY OF YOUR DATA. This means if you move the shapefiles you load into your map after you save it, your map will break.</p>
	<p>So dedicate a folder to each map you work on. Put your shapefiles and your map file in there and don't move them around.</p>
	
	<h2>What is a shapefile?</h2>
	<p>A shapefile is the most common vector feature type. It is comprised of a series of other files including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>.shp - the feature geometry</li>
		<li>.shx - positioning index of the feature geometry</li>
		<li>.dbf - the data attributes for the features. This can be opened with editors like excel.</li>
		<li>.prj - projection file. This can also be opened and analyzed. Especially if you're having projection issues.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Naming your files</h2>
	<p>There are going to be projects you work on that will require you to slice and dice a shapefile in many different ways. You need to be careful what you name each file so you aren't analyzing old shapefiles.</p>
	<p>I would strongly recommend taking detailed notes about how you change shapefiles so you can return to the notes in case you lose track of which file is which, or if something goes wrong and you need to diagnose a problem.</p>

		<figcaption>Here's an example of bad file naming. Notice the folders labelled "_old". What does that mean. I made that folder and I don't know what it means. Sigh.</figcaption>
